## Transcriptome annotation of livestock genomes

Pipeline for transcriptome annotation of genomes using nanopore sequencing technology

This project is in process, and documentation and description are still improving.

## Data preparation
To run this pipeline, following files should be prepared:
  1. Reference genome:
      * fa
      * gtf
  2. Fastq files:
      * tissue_sampleid.fq.gz

## Configuration file
